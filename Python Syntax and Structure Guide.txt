python program.py, -arg1, -arg2



7
What will be the output of code given

Below is the code written in activity_seven.py file. What will be the output of the code if you run the script with arguments 5 10 15?

import sys

sum = int(sys.argv[1]) + int(sys.argv[2])
average = (sum + int(sys.argv[3]))/2

print("Sum:", sum)
print("Average:", average)

Sum: 15
Average: 15

Sum: 30
Average: 10

Sum: 15
Average: 15.0[ans]

Sum: 30
Average: 15


8
Create a python script

Create a Python script named print_message.py that takes a message as an argument and prints it. The script should be able to run like this:

python print_message.py "Hello, DataWars!"
You have to create a script in the current directory and run it with the given message as an argument.


print("Hello,", "Welcome to DataWars!")

[ans]message = sys.argv[1]
    # Print the message
    print(message)


9
Name it Right!

Create a Python script that defines three variables: first_name, age, and is_student. Name the file variables_activity_9.py and run it to check if the variables are created correctly.

Name the file variables_activity_9.py and run it to check if the variables are created correctly.

In the first line of the script, create a variable named first_name and assign it the value "Alice". In the second line, create a variable named age and assign it the value 25. In the third line, create a variable named is_student and assign it the value True.

In the next 3 lines, print the values of these variables using the print() function.

Expected outcome:

Expected output after running the script:

Alice
25
True  

[ans]
# Define variables
first_name = "Alice"
age = 25
is_student = True

# Print variable values
print(first_name)
print(age)
print(is_student)



10
Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius

Write a Python script that takes the temperature in Fahrenheit as input from the user and converts it to Celsius. Create a script named temperature_converter.py and run it to check if the conversion is correct.

Use the input() function to take the temperature in Fahrenheit as input.
Convert the input to an integer.
Convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius using the formula: Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9.
Print the temperature in Celsius.
Expected outcome:

Expected output after running the script:

Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: 32
Temperature in Celsius: 0.0




ANS:  # Get temperature in Fahrenheit from user
fahrenheit = int(input("Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: "))

# Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius
celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9

# Print the temperature in Celsius
print("Temperature in Celsius:", celsius)
