11.Fix the Target Search Logic

The following code is intended to search for a specific target number in a list and return "Target Found" if the number is present. Identify and correct these issues to make the function work correctly.

Correct!
def find_target(numbers, target):
    for num in numbers:
        if num == target:
            return "Target Found"
    return "Target Not Found"



12.Filter Odd Numbers from a List

Write a function called filter_odd_numbers that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list containing only the odd numbers, skipping even numbers using the continue statement.

Correct!
def filter_odd_numbers(numbers):
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:

    if num > 0:  # Check if the number is positive
        sign = "Positive"
        sum = 0
        for i in range(1, num):  # Loop through numbers from 1 to num-1
            if i == 5:  # Skip the number 5

15.Debug and Fix: Sum of Squares of Even Numbers

The provided code aims to calculate the sum of squares of all even numbers from 1 to n (exclusive). However, it contains a logical error where the loop stops prematurely. Debug and correct the code so that it calculates the desired sum correctly.

def calculate_sum_even_squares(n):
    total = 0
    for num in range(1, n):
        if num % 2 == 0:
            total += num**2
    return total



16.Identify and Return the Last Valid Number

Create a function find_last_valid that iterates through numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) and applies the following rules:

Skip numbers that are multiples of 3.
Stop the iteration if a number exceeds 30.
The function find_last_valid returns the last number that is not a multiple of 3 and is less than or equal to 30.

Correct!
def find_last_valid(n):
    last_valid = None
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % 3 == 0:  # Skip multiples of 3
            continue
        if i > 30:  # Stop when the number exceeds 30
            break
        last_valid = i  # Update the last valid number
    return last_valid
