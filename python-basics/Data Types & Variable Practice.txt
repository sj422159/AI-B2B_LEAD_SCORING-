1.Define a variable num with value 100 of integer data type.

Correct!
num = 100
print(num)

2.Define a variable score with value 100 of float data type

Correct!
score = 100.0
print(score)

3.Define a variable name of string data type with your first name.

Correct!
name = "Datawars"
print(name)

4.Identify data type of variable result

    a=42
    b="42"
    c=42.0
    result = a+int(b)+c


float


a = 42
b = "42"
c = 42.0
result = a + int(b) + c
print(type(result))


5.Simple Arithmetic with Numeric Types

Write a Python code to perform addition of two integers num1 = 10 and num2 = 20. Store the final sum in variable result. Also find the data type of the result.

Correct!
num1 = 10
num2 = 20
result = num1 + num2
print(result)
print(type(result))

6.Convert to Upper case

Write a code to convert all character of given text into upper-case. Store result in variable text_upper.

Hello, I am Datawars. I help users to learn Data Science

Correct!
text = 'Hello, I am Datawars. I help users to learn Data Science'
text_upper = text.upper()
print(text_upper)

7. Convert to Lower case

Write a code to convert all character of given text into lower-case. Store the result in variable text_lower.

PYTHON IS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

Correct!
text = 'PYTHON IS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE'
text_lower = text.lower()
print(text_lower)

8.String Concatenation

Write a Python code to concatenate the strings first_name as Alice and last_name as Brown. Don't forget to give a space in between first name and last name. Store the full name in variable full_name.

Correct!
first_name = "Alice"
last_name = "Brown"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)

9.Type Conversion and Arithmetic

Write a Python code to take a float percentage as 85.5, convert it to an integer, and then add 10 to it. Store the final output in a variable result.

percentage = 85.5
converted_percentage = int(percentage)
result = converted_percentage + 10
print(result)

10.Multi-line String Representation

Write a Python code to declare a variable student_info and assign it a multi-line string containing the student’s name as Alice, ID is 101, and score is 90. Print the variable student_info.


Correct!
student_info = """Name: Alice
ID: 101
Score: 90"""
print(student_info)

11.Boolean Operation

Write a Python code to declare two boolean variables attended_classes as True and submitted_assignment as False. Use the and operator to check if both are True. Store the value in variable result.

Correct!
attended_classes = True
submitted_assignment = False
result = attended_classes and submitted_assignment
print(result)

12.String Indexing and Slicing

Write a Python code to declare a string student_name as Alice. Store the first character and the last three characters of the string in variables first_char and last_three_chars respectively.

Correct!
student_name = "Alice"
first_char = student_name[0]
last_three_chars = student_name[-3:]
print(first_char)
print(last_three_chars)

13.Reverse a String

Write a Python code to reverse the string student_name as Alice and print the reversed name. Store the result in variable reversed_name.

Correct!
student_name = "Alice"
reversed_name = student_name[::-1]
print(reversed_name)

14.Sum of Digits of a Student ID

Write a Python code to calculate the sum of the digits of a student’s ID (student_id = 123). Store the result in variable digit_sum.

Do not use loops to solve the problem.

Correct!
student_id = 123
digits = str(student_id)
digit_sum = int(digits[0]) + int(digits[1]) + int(digits[2])
print(digit_sum)


15.Compute Final Score

Write a Python code to calculate the final score of a student by taking their exam_score as 90 and assignment_score as 40. Multiply the exam_score by 0.6 and the assignment_score by 0.4, then add them together. Store the result in variable final_score.

Correct!
exam_score = 90
assignment_score = 40
final_score = (exam_score * 0.6) + (assignment_score * 0.4)
print(final_score)
