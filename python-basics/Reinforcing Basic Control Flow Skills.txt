14.Marathon Planner
Write a function marathon_planner that calculates how many days it will take to accumulate a target total distance. The function should take two arguments:

initial_distance (float): The distance to run on the first day (in kilometers).
target_distance (float): The total target distance to accumulate (in kilometers).
Here's how the function should work:

You start by running the initial_distance on day 1.
Each subsequent day, you run 10% more distance than the previous day.
The distances from all days are added together (accumulated).
The function should return the number of days needed for the accumulated total distance to reach or exceed the target_distance.
For example, if you start with 5km and want to reach a total of 20km:

Day 1: You run 5km (Total so far: 5km)
Day 2: You run 5.5km (Total so far: 10.5km)
Day 3: You run 6.05km (Total so far: 16.55km)
Day 4: You run 6.655km (Total so far: 23.205km)
The function would return 4 days, since that's when the total accumulated distance first exceeds 20km.

Correct!
Start project before checking your activities.

def marathon_planner(initial_distance, target_distance):

    if initial_distance <= 0 or target_distance <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Distances must be positive")

    current_day_distance = initial_distance
    total_distance = initial_distance
    days = 1

    while total_distance < target_distance:
        current_day_distance += current_day_distance * 0.1  # Increase by 10%
        total_distance += current_day_distance
        days += 1

    return days



15.Vacation Budget

Write a function vacation_budget that tracks the total expenses during a vacation. The function should:

Skip any expenses greater than 500.
Stop adding expenses once the total exceeds the provided budget.
Return the total amount spent within the budget.
Correct!
Start project before checking your activities.

def vacation_budget(expenses, budget):
    total_spent = 0
    for expense in expenses:
        if expense > 500:
            continue  # Skip expenses greater than 500
        if total_spent + expense > budget:
            break  # Stop if adding the expense exceeds the budget
        total_spent += expense
    return total_spent
